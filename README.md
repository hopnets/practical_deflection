# Practical Packet Deflection in Datacenters - paper artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts for network simulations and switch implementations of Simple Deflection, Quantile-based Preemptive Deflection, and Distribution-based Preemptive Deflection. Please refer to the README file in the ``Omnet_Sims`` directory for instructions on how to run the simulations and extract the results. Additionally, the README file in the ``Switch_Implementations`` directory will guide you to the control plane and data plane code of each module.

Please refer to our CoNEXT '23 paper for more information about Simple and Preemptive Deflection. Also, feel free to contact the authors if you have any questions regarding the artifacts.
